				<h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
				<p>A hackathon is an event where a team works together to bring an idea to life. The challenge is to come up with and create a software or hardware project in 24 hours. Companies will also offer API challenges that you can go for.</p>

				<h3>How much experience do I need?</h3>
				<p>No experience is needed! A hackathon is the best opportunity for participants to learn new tools to develop their idea. Whether youâ€™ve been programming since you were 10 or have no idea what a microcontroller is, everyone has many different ways to benefit from a hackathon. It's a perfect opportunity to learn.</p>

				<h3>Who can participate?</h3>
				<p>Any student from any university or college is eligible to participate. Participation is free, but will require signing up. Only a certain number of registrants will be accepted depending on the volume of sign ups.</p>

				<h3>Can I submit an old project?</h3>
				<p>No. The purpose of a hackathon is to create something from scratch within a given time limit and to learn as you go. It is also not fair to other teams who start a project from scratch during the hackathon.</p>

				<h3>How does judging work?</h3>
				<p>Judges will come from some of the largest companies in the tech industry. They will rate hacks based on creativity, technical difficulty, design, and usefulness.</p>
				
				<h3>Will there be workshops?</h3>
				<p>Workshops on certain fundamentals of various software and hardware will be run throughout the hackathon.</p>

				<h3>Will hardware be provided?</h3>
				<p>Some hardware will be available, but will be limited.</p>

				<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
				<p>Laptop, charger, water, snacks, sleeping bag, comfortable clothes, and your creativity! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be provided.</p>

				<h3>What if I don't have a team?</h3>
				<p>There will be time at the beginning of the event to form teams before the hacking part begins.</p>

				<h3>How many team members can I have?</h3>
				<p>There can be a maximum of 4 members per team.

				<h3>Will there be travel reimbursement?</h3>
				<p>At this time we will not be providing travel reimbursement, but we are still looking into the possibility. If you are within a 5-hour driving distance, we encourage you to carpool to save money on travel. Try to get your friends to sign up as well so you can split the cost of travel. We may also send a bus to the Toronto and Waterloo areas to pick students up.</p>

				<h3>I have a question that is not listed here. Who can I ask?</h3>
				<p>Fill out the contact form at the bottom of this page, and one of our organizers will get in contact with you as soon as possible!</p>
